# Execution Governor 🏛️

**The High-Governance Execution Governor** is a local-first, PRD-driven autonomous execution platform designed for solo developers. It orchestrates high-VRAM GPU resources to transform specifications into code through hardware-isolated **Micro-VMs**.

By enforcing a strict **“No PRD → No Action”** policy, the Execution Governor eliminates agent drift and guarantees that every line of generated code is fully traceable back to a validated requirement.
